#1. Stores first name as a variable
first_name = "zachary"

#2. Stores last name as variable
last_name = "SUIDAN"

#3. Prints out, "Hello, <first name> <last name>" with the first name converted to uppercase letters and the last name converted to lowercase letters using string functions
print("Hello, " + first_name.upper() + " " + last_name.lower())

#4. Prints two newlines 
print("\n\n")

#5. Prints a quote
print("\"Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible - Francis of Assisi\"")

#6. Stores two decimal numbers as variables
first_num = 2.4
second_num = 6.3

#7. Stores operations using the two variables
num_addition = first_num + second_num
num_subtraction = first_num - second_num
num_multiplication = first_num * second_num 
num_division = second_num / first_num

#8. Prints the results of the operations
print(str(first_num) + " plus " + str(second_num) + " equals " + str(num_addition))
print(str(first_num) + " minus " + str(second_num) + " equals " + str(num_subtraction))
print(str(first_num) + " times " + str(second_num) + " equals " + str(num_multiplication))
print(str(second_num) + " divided by " + str(first_num) + " equals " + str(num_division))

#9. Stores current month as a string and day as a number
month = "October"
day = 28

#10. Prints a statement telling the date
print("\n\t\tToday is day " + str(day) + " of the month of " + month + ".")
